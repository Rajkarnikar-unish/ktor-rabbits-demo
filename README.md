# Ktor Rabbits Demo Backend

This project is a kotlin based backend project built using the new Ktor framework. As the Intellij is not the Ultimate Edition, we first generate the project using the start.ktor.io website where we are able to add multiple plugins through it.

The plugins used for this project are as follows:
<li>Routing</li>
<li>Call Logging</li>
<li>Kotlinx Serialization</li>
<li>Static Content</li>
